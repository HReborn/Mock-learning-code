# Krew-Profit-Calculator
An executable to calculate profit taking into account the cargo characteristics like space that occupies, price to buy in an island and to sell at another. And with those, calculate the profit. The first version will have the hardcoded values like islands, prices and distance/time that it takes from an island to another. V2 will use the API to get those info.

## How to use on console

**1. Create a new calculator object with an optional level of detail**
   - Default level of detail set as core
     ```
     Calculator calc = new Calculator();
     ```
   - Especifying from header, core or detailed
     ```
     Calculator calc = new Calculator(LevelOfDetail.DETAILED);
     ```
*Obs: It's possible to change the level of detail to be shown with `calc.setLevelOfDetail(LevelOfDetail levelOfDetail)`*
     
**2. Choose from one of the three options**

   `displayNumber` is an optional varargs that represents how many options the user wants to be shown. Default is set as two. If more than one option is presented, only the first will be used.

   - Show the best options of what and where to sell from the current island
   
     ```
     List<ProfitOption> options = calc.
        calculateSellRoutesFromCurrentIsland(String currentIslandName, String shipName, int... displayNumber);
     ```
   - Show the best cargo to sell from island A to B
     ```
     List<ProfitOption> options = calc.
        calculateBestCargosFromCurrentToTargetIsland(String currentIslandName, String sellIslandName, String shipName, int... displayNumber);
     ```
   - Show the best profit routes from all islands to the current island the most profitable route will have a better chance of encountering a player to attack
   
     *Obs: Default oponnent's ship set as trader 1.*
   
     ```
     List<ProfitOption> options = calc.
        calculateRoutesToAttackFromCurrentIsland(String currentIslandName, int... displayNumber);
     ```
**3. Print resulting list**

  - Print with `LevelOfDetail.HEADER`
    ```
    Calculator calc = new Calculator(LevelOfDetail.HEADER);
    List<ProfitOption> options = calc.calculateRoutesToAttackFromCurrentIsland("labrador");
    System.out.println(options);
    ```
    Output: 
    ```

    Phillipines(Gems) -> Labrador
    Trader 1
    , 
    Spain(Gems) -> Labrador
    Trader 1
    ]
    ```
  - Print with `LevelOfDetail.CORE`
    ```
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    List<ProfitOption> options = calc.calculateSellRoutesFromCurrentIsland("spain", "trader 1", 5);
    System.out.println(options);
    ```
    Output:
